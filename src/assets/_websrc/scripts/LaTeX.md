## LaTeX

### Vscode `.tex` `file formatting on save

Tools:

1. LaTeX-Workshop extension;
2. latexindent.pl
3. Save and Run extension(optional);

#### Toggle formatter

##### Option 1

While using LaTeX-Workshop+latexindent.pl, it will never toggle the indent process.

I fix it by replace the extension's setting:

```json
{
  "latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
    {
      "name": "latexmk ðŸ”ƒ",
      // add tool "latexindent" as the second step of this recipes
      "tools": ["latexmk", "latexindent"]
    }
  ],
  "latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
    // previous tools should be remained ....

    // adding a new tool named latexindent
    {
      "name": "latexindent",
      "command": "latexindent",
      "args": ["%DOC_EXT%", "-w"],
      "env": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Option 2: Extension "Save and Run"

```json
"saveAndRun": {
  "commands": [
    {
      "match": "\\.tex$",
      "cmd": "latexindent '${file}' -o '${file}' -s -g /dev/null",
      "useShortcut": false,
      "silent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Environment modules for latexindent.pl

Refer to: https://latexindentpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendices.html#mac

#### no backup file and log file

`-o`: no backup;

`-g /dev/null`: no log;

```bash
latexindent '${file}' -o '${file}' -s -g /dev/null"
```

#### Update latexindent.pl

The latexindent.pl which brought by MacTex might out of date. Replace it manually by replacing it on the mac.

It might located at:

```bash
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent/LatexIndent/
```
