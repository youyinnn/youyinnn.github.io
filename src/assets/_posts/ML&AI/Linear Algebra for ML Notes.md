### Week 1

#### System of Sentences

Sentences are linear algebra equations for organizing the world's information.

##### Terms

1. Complete/Redundant/Contradictory System;

   Non-singular System -> Complete System;

   Singular System -> Redundant/Contradictory System;

   The geometric notion of Singularity: We change the constants of the equations to zero, and then the lines move to the origin.

   $$ad$$ is the product of the main diagonal, and $$bc$$ is the product of the antidiagonal.
