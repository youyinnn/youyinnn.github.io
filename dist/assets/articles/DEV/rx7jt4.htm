<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section, we will go through all the main concepts of docker technologies such as : <strong>Docker Engine</strong>, <strong>Docker Architecture</strong>, <strong>Docker underlying technology</strong>.</p>
<p>Basically reprinted from: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview">https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview</a>, but I will make some adjustment for better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="docker-engine">Docker Engine</h3>
<p><em>Docker Engine</em> is a client-server application with these major components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the <code>dockerd</code> command).</li>
<li>A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.</li>
<li>A command line interface (CLI) client (the <code>docker</code> command).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/engine-components-flow.png" alt="engine-components-workflow"></p>
<p>The CLI uses the Docker REST API to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI.</p>
<p>The daemon creates and manages Docker <em>objects</em>, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.</p>
<h3 id="docker-architecture">Docker architecture</h3>
<p>Docker uses a <strong>client-server architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>The Docker <em>client</em> talks to the Docker <em>daemon</em>, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon <em>can</em> run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.</p>
<p><strong>The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface.</strong></p>

<h4 id="1-the-docker-daemon-core">1. The Docker daemon (core)</h4>
<p>The Docker daemon (<code>dockerd</code>) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.</p>
<h4 id="2-the-docker-client-interface">2. The Docker client (interface)</h4>
<p>The Docker client (<code>docker</code>) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as <code>docker run</code>, the client sends these commands to <code>dockerd</code>, which carries them out. The <code>docker</code> command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.</p>
<h4 id="3-docker-registries-store">3. Docker registries (store)</h4>
<p>A Docker <em>registry</em> stores Docker images. Docker Hub and Docker Cloud are public registries that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry. If you use Docker Datacenter (DDC), it includes Docker Trusted Registry (DTR).</p>
<p>When you use the <code>docker pull</code> or <code>docker run</code> commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the <code>docker push</code> command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.</p>
<p><a href="http://store.docker.com/">Docker store</a> allows you to buy and sell Docker images or distribute them for free. For instance, you can buy a Docker image containing an application or service from a software vendor and use the image to deploy the application into your testing, staging, and production environments. You can upgrade the application by pulling the new version of the image and redeploying the containers.</p>
<h4 id="4-docker-objects-components">4. Docker objects (components)</h4>
<p>When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.</p>
<h5 id="images">IMAGES</h5>
<p>An <em>image</em> is a <strong>read-only template</strong> with instructions for creating a Docker container.</p>
<p>Often, an image is <em>based on</em> another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the <code>ubuntu</code> image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.</p>
<p>You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a <em>Dockerfile</em> with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.</p>
<h5 id="containers">CONTAINERS</h5>
<p><strong>A container is a runnable instance of an image.</strong> You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.</p>
<p>By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine.</p>
<p><strong>You can control how isolated a containerâ€™s network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine.</strong></p>
<p>A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear.</p>
<h5 id="services">SERVICES</h5>
<p>Services allow you to scale containers across multiple Docker daemons, which all work together as a <em>swarm</em> with multiple <em>managers</em> and <em>workers</em>. Each member of a swarm is a Docker daemon, and the daemons all communicate using the Docker API. A service allows you to define the desired state, such as the number of replicas of the service that must be available at any given time. By default, the service is load-balanced across all worker nodes. To the consumer, the Docker service appears to be a single application. Docker Engine supports swarm mode in Docker 1.12 and higher.</p>
<h3 id="the-underlying-technology">The underlying technology</h3>
<p>Docker is written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality.</p>
<h4 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h4>
<p>Docker uses a technology called <code>namespaces</code> to provide the isolated workspace called the <em>container</em>. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of <em>namespaces</em> for that container.</p>
<p>These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.</p>
<p>Docker Engine uses namespaces such as the following on Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The pid namespace:</strong> Process isolation (PID: Process ID).</li>
<li><strong>The net namespace:</strong> Managing network interfaces (NET: Networking).</li>
<li><strong>The ipc namespace:</strong> Managing access to IPC resources (IPC: InterProcess Communication).</li>
<li><strong>The mnt namespace:</strong> Managing filesystem mount points (MNT: Mount).</li>
<li><strong>The uts namespace:</strong> Isolating kernel and version identifiers. (UTS: Unix Timesharing System).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="control-groups">Control groups</h4>
<p>Docker Engine on Linux also relies on another technology called <em>control groups</em> (<code>cgroups</code>). A cgroup limits an application to a specific set of resources. Control groups allow Docker Engine to share available hardware resources to containers and optionally enforce limits and constraints. For example, you can limit the memory available to a specific container.</p>
<h4 id="union-file-systems">Union file systems</h4>
<p>Union file systems, or <strong>UnionFS</strong>, are file systems that operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker Engine uses UnionFS to provide the building blocks for containers. Docker Engine can use multiple UnionFS variants, including AUFS, btrfs, vfs, and DeviceMapper.</p>
<h4 id="container-format">Container format</h4>
<p>Docker Engine combines the namespaces, control groups, and UnionFS into a wrapper called a container format. The default container format is <code>libcontainer</code>. In the future, Docker may support other container formats by integrating with technologies such as BSD Jails or Solaris Zones.</p>
